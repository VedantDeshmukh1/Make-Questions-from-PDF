# Make-Questions-from-PDF


This project extracts questions from uploaded PDFs using a combination of LangChain, Google Gemini-Pro API, and the ai21 J2-Ultra model.

### Features

* Extracts questions from a variety of PDF formats.
* Leverages the power of LangChain for natural language processing.
* Utilizes Google Gemini-Pro API for advanced question identification.
* Integrates ai21 J2-Ultra model for further question extraction accuracy.

### Usage

This project can be run in two ways:

1. **Google Colab:**
    * Upload the `ipynb` file to your Colab notebook.
    * Follow the instructions within the notebook to set up the environment and run the application.

2. **Local Machine:**
    * Install the required dependencies (listed in the `requirements.txt` file).
    * Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```

**Note:** You will need to obtain API keys for both Google Gemini-Pro and ai21 J2-Ultra and configure them within the code.

### Sample Questions

Two sample files of the questions are included in the folder ```Generated Q&A```:

* `gemini-pro.txt`: Questions extracted using LangChain.
* `j2-ultra.txt`: Questions extracted using the ai21 J2-Ultra model.

These files provide an example of the output generated by each model.

### Dependencies

* LangChain
* Google Gemini-Pro API (requires API key)
* ai21 J2-Ultra (requires API key)
* Streamlit

The specific version requirements for each dependency can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
